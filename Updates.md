This week in our project we used pdf.js to get a basic pdf reader and parser up and running. Moving forward, 
we plan on polishing both our pdf and text readers, as well as the visuals of the project as a whole. When this
is completed, we will do research into other files formats it may be possible to implement compatibility with
given the current time frame, and move forward towards creating a finished product avaliable in the the chrome
extension marketplace.
