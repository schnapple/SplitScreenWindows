  "readme": "# harb\n\nHost of Archaic Representations of Books (parsing).  Designed to provide support\nfor [j](https://github.com/SheetJS/j).  Pure-JS cleanroom implementation.\n\nCurrently supported formats:\n\n- DIF (Data Interchange Format)\n- CSV/TSV/TXT\n- SYLK (Symbolic Link)\n- SocialCalc\n\nPlanned but not currently implemented:\n\n- SC (Spreadsheet Calculator)\n- PRN (Space-Delimited Format)\n\n## Installation\n\nIn [nodejs](https://www.npmjs.org/package/harb):\n\n    npm install harb\n\n## Usage\n\nThis module provides support for [j](https://www.npmjs.org/package/j). For usage\ninformation, consult [the xlsx module](http://git.io/xlsx) as they use the same\ninterface and style.\n\n## Test Files\n\nTest files are housed in [another repo](https://github.com/SheetJS/test_files).\n\nRunning `make init` will refresh the `test_files` submodule and get the files.\n\n## Contributing\n\nDue to the precarious nature of the Open Specifications Promise, it is very\nimportant to ensure code is cleanroom.  Consult CONTRIBUTING.md\n\nThe harb.js file is constructed from the files in the `bits` subdirectory. The\nbuild script (run `make`) will concatenate the individual bits to produce the\nscript.  Before submitting a contribution, ensure that running make will produce\nthe harb.js file exactly.  The simplest way to test is to move the script:\n\n```\n$ mv harb.js harb.new.js\n$ make\n$ diff harb.js harb.new.js\n```\n\nTo produce the dist files, run `make dist`.  The dist files are updated in each\nversion release and should not be committed between versions.\n\n## XLSX Support\n\nXLSX is available in [js-xlsx](http://git.io/xlsx).\n\n## XLS Support\n\nXLS is available in [js-xls](http://git.io/xls).\n\n## License\n\nPlease consult the attached LICENSE file for details.  All rights not explicitly\ngranted by the Apache 2.0 license are reserved by the Original Author.\n\nIt is the opinion of the Original Author that this code conforms to the terms of\nthe Microsoft Open Specifications Promise, falling under the same terms as\nOpenOffice (which is governed by the Apache License v2).  Given the vagaries of\nthe promise, the Original Author makes no legal claim that in fact end users are\nprotected from future actions.  It is highly recommended that, for commercial\nuses, you consult a lawyer before proceeding.\n\n## References\n\nNo official specification exists for any of these formats.  For some formats, a\n\"reference implementation\" is the specification.  When implementations disagree,\nExcel's interpretation is assumed to be correct (unless Excel does not support\nthe format, in which case the application that introduced the format is assumed\nto be correct).\n\n## Badges\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SheetJS/js-harb.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SheetJS/js-harb)\n\n[![Coverage Status](http://img.shields.io/coveralls/SheetJS/js-harb/master.svg)](https://coveralls.io/r/SheetJS/js-harb?branch=master)\n\n[![githalytics.com alpha](https://cruel-carlota.pagodabox.com/ed5bb2c4c4346a474fef270f847f3f78 \"githalytics.com\")](http://githalytics.com/SheetJS/js-xlsx)\n",
